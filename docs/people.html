            <p>
                Throughout this video we learned about important mavericks for the new age internet known as Web 2.0.
                Important mavericks for the Web 2.0 were Chad Hurley, Kevin Rose, Jay Adelson, Shawn Fanning, Mark
                Zuckerberg and Craig Newmark. The companies that were founded by these individuals include: Youtube,
                Digg, Napster, Facebook and Craigslist. All these individuals were on a mission to change the way the
                web was used and enable the people who use it with all the power.

                Before things like Youtube, the traditional media companies would control who was able to be heard and
                have an impact. With these new platforms the people were given the power to be heard. Most of these
                companies were built off the theory, wisdom of crowds. This theory is the idea that large groups of
                people are collectively smarter than individual experts when it comes to problem-solving, decision
                making, innovating and predicting.

                David Weekly and Justin Frankel were pioneers who put music and computers together to create the MP3
                file. They created software to be able to play music through computers. This sparked the start of a new
                revolution for the music industry. Shawn Fanning had an idea for a new company called Napstart which was
                built off a peer to peer architecture for music. Within the first week of its existence in 1999, 10,000
                people had downloaded Napster. It was the fastest spreading software during its time. Howard King and
                Peter PAterno were american entertainment lawyers who showed musical artists how Napster was
                redistributing their music for free which caused an uproar of lawsuits. Napster was finally shut down in
                July 2001, but the internet had been changed forever.

                At the end of 2006, Google had acquired Youtube because of how it threatened big media companies and the
                potential it had. Youtube threatened big media companies because it allowed users to generate their own
                content and express their creativity. Web 2.0 was the new era of the internet and everyone knew it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web 2.0 was really enhanced with the idea of social networking. Things like Friendster, Myspace, and
                Facebook really boosted the internet for the user. The social graph was Facebook’s idea to web together
                all of its users, the social graph is defined as a representation of the interconnection of
                relationships in an online social network. Zuckerberg’s ambition is to turn Facebook into the windows of
                the web. The internet has been changed forever because of the pioneers mentioned throughout this video!
